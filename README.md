# Data Araucania
Data routing, transformation, and system mediation logic.

## Main concerns
1. After the data has been collected, they have to be loaded into remote database.
2. Giving format to xlxs files' tables to json for each file and book that it is inside on it.
3. The data is turned into sql format after json data structure has done in order to load with diagram by itself (i.e. automaticlly).
